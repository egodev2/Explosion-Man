# Explosion-Man

Made as final project for CS50's Introduction to Game Development. The game is inspired in the 16-bit games of the Bomberman franchise, with the source being in Lua because of the LÖVE engine.

## Getting Started

To get it running, you only need LÖVE 0.10.2 engine. Do NOT attemp to install a later version, or engine will display compiler errors.

### Prerequisites

The engine LÖVE v0.10.2. 

### Installing


#### Windows and MAC
Go to www.love2d.org and select "Other Versions" from the "Other Downloads" menu. Download "love-0.10.2-win64.zip" for Windows, or "love-0.10.2-macosx-x64.zip", and unzip all files in a folder. 

#### Linux
Supported only for Debian distributions. Go to www.love2d.org and select "Other Versions" from the "Other Downloads" menu. Download and install both "liblove-dbg_0.10.2ppa1_x.deb" and "liblove0_0.10.2ppa1_x.deb" where is x is your system architecture. Optionally, you can also download "love_0.10.2ppa1_x.deb" to make easier to run the game.
